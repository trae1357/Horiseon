# Horiseon:Online Marketing Management 
We are going in to and changing a few of the HTML and CSS code on the Horiseon website. I have to make sure the website is up to accessibility standards.
After updating some of the accessibility standers that will help with more google hits.
Some of the code is broken and the HTML and CSS are not linked.
I have updated a few of the website photos and layouts, as well fixed some of the functions that werent working before.
LETS HAVE SOME FUN AND LETS GET TO CODING!
